# SigLIP2 text-tower token limit
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The text tower has a hard 64-token context: Siglip2TextModel's
# position_embedding is nn.Embedding(64, hidden), so there is no max_length to
# raise and no RoPE to extrapolate. encode_text_siglip2's truncation=True
# above drops everything past it.
#
# A long query no longer has to lose that text. chunk_text() below splits it
# into sentence-aligned pieces that each fit the window, and
# QUERY_CHUNK_STRATEGIES decides what happens to the pieces -- the same three
# options AICLab/preprocess/summary-embed.ipynb offers on the corpus side, where
# chunk_text() and _split_long_unit() come from:
#
#   truncate         one vector, first 64 tokens only. The old behaviour,
#                    kept for comparison -- a long query keeps whatever it
#                    happened to say first and silently loses the rest.
#   mean_chunks      one vector: every chunk embedded, L2-normalized and
#                    averaged. A soft conjunction -- a video has to look
#                    somewhat like all of the query, not just part of it.
#                    Cheapest to consume: still one query vector, so every
#                    leg searches exactly as it always did.
#   chunks_separate  N vectors, one per chunk. Each chunk gets its own
#                    ranked list and the lists are fused with RRF
#                    (common.py's faiss_search_pooled) -- the same fusion
#                    the signals already use across their legs. A row is
#                    rewarded for ranking well against several chunks rather
#                    than for one strong match, so the chunks act as
#                    corroborating evidence. DEFAULT.
#
# The notebook max-pools its chunks, and on the corpus side that is right: a
# summary's chunks are unrelated topics, so a hit on one is a real hit. On the
# query side max-pooling would make added clauses behave like an OR -- one
# strongly-matching clause could carry a row that ignored the rest -- so the
# chunk lists are RRF-fused instead, which pays a row for placing well against
# several chunks at once. mean_chunks reaches a similar conjunction in vector
# space rather than in rank space: it is the blunter of the two (four clauses
# average into one point that may sit near none of them) but it keeps a real
# cosine score, where chunks_separate returns an RRF score. Both beat
# truncate, which just deletes the tail.
#
# siglip2_long_query_note() reports when a query was over the window and what
# was done about it -- worth surfacing either way, since the Elasticsearch
# legs see the raw string regardless. See backend/routes/search/signals.py and
# trake.py's `warning` fields.
