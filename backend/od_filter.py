"""
backend/od_filter.py -- OD (object-detection) text filter: fuzzy-matches
free-text, comma-separated class tokens against the offline class
vocabulary (AICLab/preprocess/build_class_vocab.py -> filtered_objects/class_vocab.csv)
and applies the matched classes as an AND post-filter over an
already-ranked result DataFrame, keeping only rows whose keyframe's OD
detections (filtered_objects/{video_id}.csv) include every matched class.

Call sites (backend/routes/search.py) always run this AFTER a signal's own
ranking is final -- after RRF fusion for an RRF leg, after the raw score
ranking for a plain leg -- and always right before the top_k head()
truncation, so the filter sees the full fetch_k-sized candidate pool
rather than an already-truncated top_k. Per the spec this only ever
narrows results, never blanks the page: zero matched tokens is a no-op
(unmatched tokens are skipped, not blocking), and a filter that would
empty the candidate list falls back to the unfiltered ranking instead.
