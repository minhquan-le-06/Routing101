"""
backend/filters/metadata.py -- structured facet filter over the per-lot
metadata extracted into AICData/extracted/metadata/*.csv (subject/topic for L25, province for
L27-29, ...). Not every extracted CSV yields a good *facet* -- a facet needs
low cardinality (a handful of pickable values), so this only exposes the two
dimensions that qualify: "subject" (L25, 9 values) and "province" (L27-29,
low single digits). L26's dish_name, and L27-29's site/host, are too
high-cardinality to browse as a dropdown -- they stay in the CSVs for
reference/fuzzy-search use, not wired in here.

Same call shape as backend/filters/objects.py: an AND post-filter applied after a
leg's own ranking, right alongside apply_filters (video/lot scope) in
backend/routes/search/signals.py, since this is exactly that -- a third scope
dimension, just video-level metadata instead of video_id/lot-number. Unlike
od_filter, an empty result here is left empty rather than falling back to
unfiltered: od_filter's fuzzy per-frame class match can plausibly miss
everything in a small candidate pool even when the class truly is present
elsewhere, but this filter is an exact match against a hand-verified value
picked from a dropdown -- "no video in this pool is tagged X" is a real,
correct answer, not a filter that's too aggressive to trust.
