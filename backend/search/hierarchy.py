backend/search/hierarchy.py -- Hierarchy Search, three steps:
  1. A SigLIP2 frame search (text or picture query), grouped by video like
     Keyframe's "group by video".
  2. Per video, a seed-frame picker -- which of that group's own frames
     becomes the NEW picture query for step 3. Defaults to the group's
     top-1 frame; changing it only affects that one video.
  3. Drill-down: the chosen seed frame is embedded and searched scoped to
     that one video, pulling in up to Top-G frames total per video
     (default G=5, "Expand" bumps one video's own G by +10).
This only ever uses the SigLIP2 frame leg -- fuzzy legs have no
picture-query counterpart, and the drill-down step is a picture query by
construction (the seed is a frame's own thumbnail), so there's no
meaningful text/RRF path to offer here at all.
