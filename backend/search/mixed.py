"""
backend/search/mixed.py -- the legs+weights composite signal: a
user-weighted RRF across Keyframe/ASR/Caption/OCR (not Summary --
video-level, kept out of this signal). Keyframe and OCR have no leg choice -- Keyframe's CLIP leg was removed
entirely (see backend/search/keyframe.py), leaving a single SigLIP2 leg;
OCR was always fuzzy-only -- so both are used at their own raw rank
whenever their weight is > 0. ASR/Caption still offer 2 legs each: only
their *checked* legs contribute, 2 checked legs are fused with that
signal's own existing rrf_fuse_* first (so this composite reuses the exact
same per-signal RRF already used standalone), 1 checked leg is used at its
own raw rank, 0 checked legs (or a 0 weight) drop the signal entirely. The
resulting per-signal rank lists are then combined with a weighted RRF,
keyed on (video_id, n) since every signal is normalized to that shape
already.

The standalone "Mixed" tab (`backend/routes/search.py::search_mixed`) no
longer uses `_mixed_*_df` below -- it moved to many independent
single-signal sub-queries (see that route's own docstring) -- but does
reuse `rrf_fuse_weighted()`, keyed by sub-query index instead of signal
name. `_mixed_*_df` themselves now only back TRAKE's per-event "Mixed"
signal option (`backend/search/trake.py::trake_search_event`), which still
works exactly as this module describes.
