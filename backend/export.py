"""
backend/export.py -- AIC submission CSV export: ranking/dedup logic that
turns a query's answer (a confirmed frame, or a user-curated ordered list)
plus its search candidates into <=99 rows for one query's submission CSV,
per the AIC scoring model (Final Score = average of R@k for k in
{1, 5, 20, 50, 100}, where R@k = max score among the first k rows -- so
only the best-scoring row within each threshold band matters, and a
duplicate of an already-placed row can never raise that max, only waste a
slot). Pure logic, no FastAPI/file I/O -- mirrors the backend/search/*.py
vs backend/routes/*.py split already used for TRAKE; backend/routes/results/export.py
is the thin endpoint (+ two small preview-data routes) on top of this
module.

KIS/VQA row structure (the export popup's "answer/similar/neighbours-of-
similar" tiers):
  confirmed mode:  [confirmed frame] + [its nearest keyframes by time] +
                    [similar-semantic candidates] + [nearest keyframes by
                    time of each similar, as filler] -- up to max_rows.
  unconfirmed mode: [user-ordered answer frames, kept in order] + [similar-
                    semantic candidates] + [nearest keyframes by time of
                    each similar, as filler] -- up to max_rows.
Confirmed mode's "similar-semantic candidates" are a fresh visual search
seeded by the confirmed frame itself (similar_candidates_for_frame()
below, backed by backend/search/keyframe.py's SigLIP2 frame index) rather
than the caller's original query results -- "similar to the picked
image", since a human just confirmed *that* frame is the answer, not
necessarily the best-ranked hit of whatever query found it. Unconfirmed
mode has no single confirmed frame to re-query from, so it still uses
the caller-supplied candidates (the opener tab's last search results)
as before. Either way, generate_export() below just takes whatever
`candidates` list it's given -- routes/results/export.py's /api/export handler
is what picks which one to pass, per mode.
"Nearest keyframes by time" is keyframe-only by default (picks from the
video's own existing extracted n's, ordered by |n - center| -- equivalent
to time-gap order since map-keyframes rows are chronological). The Export
tab's "Keyframes" checkbox unchecked switches to native mode instead (the
confirmed frame/answers are a raw {video_id, frame_idx} straight from
video playback rather than an indexed keyframe {video_id, n}) --
generate_export(..., keyframes=False) then builds that one tier in
frame_idx space via _event_neighbour_stream (TRAKE's own dual keyframe-
distance/frame-number-distance neighbour logic, reused as-is) and its
"similar-semantic" search snaps to the nearest keyframe first
(similar_candidates_for_native_frame(), since a raw frame has no SigLIP2
embedding of its own to search from). Everything else -- the similar/
filler tiers themselves, rows_to_csv_text()'s formatting -- is unaffected
either way.

TRAKE row structure is different in kind, not just in row shape, and lives
entirely outside generate_export()/rows_to_csv_text() below -- see
generate_trake_rows() and its own docstring. A TRAKE answer is a human's
exact (video_id, frame_idx_1..N) pick from watching the video directly, in
*native* frame_idx space -- there's no keyframe `n` to translate, unlike
KIS/VQA. There's no confirmed/unconfirmed distinction for TRAKE any more:
curation happens per video (an ordered event list, each a native
frame_idx, built by watching that video in the Export tab), row generation
happens per video into an in-memory cache (frontend/js/export/ui.js), and
a human merges however many cached videos they curated into one final
<=99-row CSV at export time -- see generate_trake_rows()'s docstring for
the row-generation half of that, and ARCHITECTURE.md's "Export
architecture" section for the curate/cache/merge flow end to end.

Deliberately reuses the app's *existing* result-dict shapes instead of a
parallel Candidate model:
  - KIS/VQA candidates ("similars"): {video_id, n, rank, score_label,
    score_val, text} (backend/search/common.py::df_to_results -- what every
    non-TRAKE signal already returns).
  - KIS/VQA confirmed/answers: {video_id, n} (n = the app's internal
    1-indexed keyframe ordinal).

KIS/VQA rows built here stay n-space; rows_to_csv_text() below does the n
-> frame_idx translation AIC submissions actually expect (frame_idx_for_n
in backend/core/keyframes.py) plus final text formatting -- kept separate so the
ranking/dedup logic is testable without touching map-keyframes files. TRAKE
rows (video_id + a list of already-native frame_idxs, straight from
generate_trake_rows() or a merge of several cached calls to it) are always
already resolved to frame_idx, so rows_to_csv_text() does no lookup for
them.
